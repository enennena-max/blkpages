# üîí BlkPages Referral Fraud Prevention Guide

This document outlines the complete fraud prevention system for the BlkPages referral program.

## üß± Fraud Prevention Checks

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Signup-Level Protection

**Self-Referral Blocking**
- Blocks if referrer and referee have same email
- Blocks if referrer and referee have same mobile number

**Duplicate Phone Detection**
- Checks if the referee's phone number is already registered to another account
- Prevents one person from creating multiple accounts with the same phone

**Device Fingerprint Tracking**
- Tracks device fingerprints for each referral signup
- Blocks referrals from devices that have already been used for signups
- Prevents reusing the same device to game the system

**Payment Card Hash Detection**
- Tracks hashed payment card information (optional)
- Blocks referrals using the same payment card across multiple accounts
- Prevents creating fake accounts with the same payment method

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Booking-Level Protection

**First Booking Only**
- Referral bonus only awarded on referee's FIRST completed booking
- Subsequent bookings don't trigger additional bonuses
- Prevents earning multiple referral bonuses from the same person

**Duplicate Bonus Prevention**
- Checks if referral bonus already exists for this referee
- Prevents duplicate bonuses if booking completion is triggered multiple times

**Self-Referral Safety Check**
- Double-checks that referrer and referee are different users
- Extra validation in booking completion logic

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ 24-Hour Confirmation Window

**Pending Status**
- All referral bonuses start as "pending"
- Points are not added to balance until 24 hours after booking completion

**Cancellation Protection**
- If booking is cancelled/refunded within 24 hours, bonus is released (not awarded)
- Protects against short-term bookings made just for referral bonus

**Automatic Confirmation**
- After 24 hours, if booking is still "completed", bonus is confirmed
- Points automatically added to referrer's balance

## üìä Admin Monitoring

### Suspicious Referral Detection

Query endpoint: `GET /api/admin/suspicious-referrals`

**Flags referrers who:**
- Have more than 5 referrals
- Have device ratio < 80% (same devices used repeatedly)
- Have phone ratio < 80% (same phone numbers used repeatedly)

**Returns:**
- Risk score (0-100)
- Total referrals
- Unique devices, phones, IPs
- Full referral list for investigation
